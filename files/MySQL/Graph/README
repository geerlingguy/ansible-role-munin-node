%graphs contains the graph definitions, it is indexed on the graph
name. The information stored for each graph is used for both showing
data source values and for printing the graph configuration. Each
graph follows the followingformat:

$graph{NAME} => {
    config => {
        # The global attributes for this graph
        global_attrs => {} 
        # Attributes common to all data sources in this graph
        data_source_attrs => {}
    },
    data_sources => [
        # NAME - The name of the data source (e.g. variable names 
        #        from SHOW STATUS)
        # DATA_SOURCE_ATTRS - key-value pairs with data source 
        #                     attributes
        {name => 'NAME', (DATA_SOURCE_ATTRS)},
        {...},
    ],
